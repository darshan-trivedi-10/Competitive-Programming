Euclidean algorithm for computing the greatest common divisor

Given two non-negative integers a and b, we have to find their GCD (greatest common divisor)
i.e. the largest number which is a divisor of both a and b. It's commonly denoted by gcd(a,b).

                 gcd(a,b) = { a, if b = 0
                                 { gcd(b, a%b), otherwise.

--> Let GCD of A and B = g
    Observation 1 : GCD(A,0) = GCD(0,A) = A
    Observation 2 : GCD(A,B) = GCD(B,A)
    Observation 1 : GCD(A,B) = GCD(A-B,A) = GCD(A, B-A)

Euclidean algorithm works in O(log(min(a,b))).

// Implementation
int gcd(int a, int b)
{
    if (b == 0)
        return a;
    else
        return (b, a % b);
}

// Using the ternary operator in C++, we can write it as a one-liner.
int gcd(int a, int b)
{
    return b ? gcd(b, a % b) : a;
}
// And finally, here is a non-recursive implementation:

int gcd(int a, int b)
{
    while (b)
    {
        a %= b;
        swap(a, b);
    }
    return a;

/*

Least common multiple

--> Calculating the least common multiple (commonly denoted LCM) can be reduced to calculating the GCD with the
     following simple formula:

lcm(a,b)= (aâ‹…b)/gcd(a,b).

Thus, LCM can be calculated using the Euclidean algorithm with the same time complexity:

A possible implementation, that cleverly avoids integer overflows by first dividing a with the GCD, is given here:

int lcm(int a, int b)
